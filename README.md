# MTGCN

A Multi-Task learning method, called MTGCN, based on the Graph Convolutional Network to identify cancer driver genes
Run the MTCGN should under the environment of python >=3.7 , pytorch >=1.6.0 and pytorch geometric >=1.7.0

1. invoke the deepwalk.py to obtain structure features.
2. invoke the MTGCN.py

The final result return a list of predicted value of each unlabeled gene.
